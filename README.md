Set the following environment variables to control and configure the behaviour of the application:

|Name|Default|Description|
|-|:-:|-|

|Key|Value|
|-|-|
|Actions permissions|Allow all actions and reusable workflows|
|Artifact and log retention|`30 days`|
|Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators|Require approval for all outside collaborators|
|Workflow permissions|Read repository contents and packages permissions|
|Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests|`false`|

After integration is done, change the badges of this `README.md` to point to the new repository.
